# Introductory Geocoding and Mapping

This workshop is based off Juan Shishido's Introductory Geocoding and Mapping workshop available at: https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/geocoding-workshop 

Changes include
- uses geopy & Google Maps API instead of DSTK, due to DSTK being intermittently down. 
- does not cover batch geocoding using DSTK

The workshop is split between a short lecture with code snippets to try, followed by a tutorial which we work through together. 

Slides for the lecture can be viewed here: http://dlab-berkeley.github.io/geocoding-geopy/slides/index.html#1

For the tutorial: 
- To run intro-geocoding.ipynb as IPython notebook (interactive), download zip or git clone, navigate to extracted folder in terminal, and type "ipython notebook."
- To view IPython notebook as static webpage (not interactive), go to: http://dlab-berkeley.github.io/geocoding-geopy/intro-geocoding.html
